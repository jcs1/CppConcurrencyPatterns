# Thread-Specific Storage

* Concurrent Architecture Pattern

* An event-driven framework to demultiplex and dispatch service requests concurrently onto various service providers.

## Summary

* For each supported service type implement an event handler that fulfils the specific client request.

* Register this service handler within the Reactor.

* The Reactor uses an event demultiplexer to wait synchronously on all incoming events.

* When an event arrives, the Reactor is notified and dispatches it to the specific service.

## Advantages

* A clear separation of framework and application logic.

* The Reactor can be ported to various platforms, because the underlying event demultiplexing functions are widely available.

* The separation of interface and implementation enables easy adaption or extension of the services.

* Overall structure supports the concurrent execution.

## Disadvantages

* Requires an event demultiplexing system call.

* A long-running event handler can block the Reactor.

* The inversion of control makes testing and debugging more difficult.
